This is a project of philosophy, so why not think about how should we speed up
how we process things, doing calculations in parallel, but there is a catch, you
cannot deal with the same thing in parallel, you must use mutexes and define
what can you do, and what you cannot do, of a list of todos...

- I still don't understand this project.
